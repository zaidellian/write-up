Open file with xxd we have:

xxd TheMessage.txt

We see a lot spaces and dots. Then, I think about changing the string into binary with a little code.

inp = open("TheMessage.txt", "r")
l = list(inp.read())
string = ""
for i in range(0, len(l)):
    if l[i] == " ":
        l[i] = '0'
    else:
        l[i] = '1'
    if i % 8 == 0:
        string += ' '
    string += l[i]

outp = open("output.txt", "w")
outp.write(string)

Run that file and we have a binary string, decode it and we found the flag.
