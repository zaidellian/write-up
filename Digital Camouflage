The main idea finding the flag is Network Interception and some Crytographic Techniques.
Step-1:

After downloading data.pcap from the cloud, I directly opened it in Wireshark.

For those, who are unaware of how to use this tool for Network Interception, can refer here: https://www.wireshark.org/

I tried to check the Hex Dump, but couldn't find something special.
Step-2:

So, I tried to check the TCP stream in different frames. For those, who are unaware on how to do this:

    Open data.pcap in Wireshark.
    In the filters, put on TCP and then Enter to get all the TCP traffic of the network.
    I wanted to check each and every frame as question is somewhat hinting in that direction, so to check that, Analyse -> Follow -> TCP Stream
    We can alter streams by changing the counter in bottom right corner.
    As I reached 3rd stream, I observed some credentials there.

userid=hardawayn&pswrd=UEFwZHNqUlRhZQ%3D%3D
Step-3:

So, it is clear that password is Base64 encrypted and in web URLs, %3D is to be replaced by =.

So I tried to decode the Base64 encryption online at: https://www.base64decode.org/

It had the flag in it. Voila.
Step-4:

Finally the flag becomes: PApdsjRTae
