The main idea finding the flag using simple forensic techniques.
Step-1:

After we download PikesPeak.jpg, we try to open and see the flag and check if we find any.
Step-2:

I tried simple techniques and easily found answer when we send the command:

strings PikesPeak.jpg | grep {

I and got this as output:

CTFLEARN{PikesPeak}
CTFLearn{Colorado}
%ctflearn{MountainMountainMountain}
#cTfLeArN{CTFMountainCTFmOUNTAIN}
CTF{AsPEN.Vail}
CTFlearn{Gandalf}
ctflearning{AUCKLAND}
ctfLEARN{MtDoom}
6ctflearninglearning{Mordor.TongariroAlpineCrossing}
+CTFLEARN{MountGedePangrangoNationalPark}

Step-4:

I tried all the flags up there xP.

However one of them worked out.
Step-5:

Finally the flag becomes: CTFlearn{Gandalf}
