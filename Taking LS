The main idea finding the flag using simple LS commands to find hidden passwords and flag.
Step-1:

After we download the given zip The Flag.zip from the cloud, we just try simple techniques.

After we unzip the 2 folders in it, we get 2 directories named __MACOSX & The Flag.
Step-2:

I went into The Flag directory and tried ls -al command to get following output:

total 40
drwxr-xr-x 3 rishit rishit  4096 Oct 30  2016  .
drwxr-xr-x 4 rishit rishit  4096 Jul 10 16:13  ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 rishit rishit  6148 Oct 30  2016  .DS_Store
-rw-r--r-- 1 rishit rishit 16647 Oct 30  2016 'The Flag.pdf'
drwxr-xr-x 2 rishit rishit  4096 Oct 30  2016  .ThePassword

Note: The Flag.pdf is password protected. We need to retrieve the password.
Step-3:

Next, I got into .ThePassword directory and tried ls command to get this:

ThePassword.txt

Step-4:

Let's do a cat ThePassword.txt to get the Password.

Nice Job!  The Password is "Im The Flag".
Step-5:

Let's try this password on The Flag.pdf and its works!
Step-7:

Finally the flag becomes: ABCTF{T3Rm1n4l_is_C00l}
