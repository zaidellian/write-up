Step-1:

After downloading Boris_Ivanov_1.jpg from the cloud, I tried all basic Forensics Techniques, but I got nothing.

NULL. NATA. ZIP.
Step-2:

I tried to use the Stegsolver application. For those who don't have it, can get the script from here:

https://github.com/zardus/ctf-tools/tree/master/stegsolve

After installation is complete, running ./stegsolver.jar will launch the application.
Step-3:

After reading the challenge again and again we can notice the word KGB may bay relate to Steganography by RGB.

In Stegsolver, there are 1000 offsets possible.
Step-4:

Luckily, after analyzing the image, I started to filter backwards and got flag at 898 offset.

I got the flag there.
Step-5:

Finally the flag becomes: flag{d0nt_m3s5_w1th_th3_KGB}
