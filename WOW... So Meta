However, the flag is not visible inside the image and it is not hidden in its content. However, we can find the flag in the file metadata.

We can use exiftool to extract the file metadata and then filter by CTFlearn using grep:

$ exiftool 3UWLBAUCb9Z2.jpg | grep CTFlearn
Camera Serial Number        : CTFlearn{EEe_x_I_FFf}
