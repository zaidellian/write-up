The main idea finding the flag using simple Git commands to find hidden passwords and flag.
Step-1:

After we download the given zip gitIsGood.zip from the cloud, we just try simple techniques.

After we unzip, we get a directory called gitisGood.
Step-2:

I went into gitisGood directory and tried ls -al command to get following output:

total 16
drwxr-xr-x 3 rishit rishit 4096 Oct 30  2016 .
drwxr-xr-x 3 rishit rishit 4096 Jul 10 16:43 ..
-rw-r--r-- 1 rishit rishit   15 Oct 30  2016 flag.txt
drwxr-xr-x 8 rishit rishit 4096 Oct 30  2016 .git

Step-3:

Next, I tried cat flag.txt, but seems like that flag flag{REDACTED} is incorrect.
Step-4:

So we try to explore the .git directory. Get into that directory to know the changes that were done on the flag.txt
Step-5:

I tried git log and came to know that the file was changed 3 times by the following output:

Step-6:

So to know the changes we need to add some additional flag and the command becomes:

git log -p

The output is as follows:

commit d10f77c4e766705ab36c7f31dc47b0c5056666bb (HEAD -> master)

Step-7:

Finally the flag becomes: flag{protect_your_git}
