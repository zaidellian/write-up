The hint is: “Steghide Might be Helpfull”. Then, we will use Steghide in this challenge.

But, we need a passphrase to extract data from the image.

We have to find the passphrase by using strings command.

The string “myadmin” is a readable string, so I think it might be the passphrase we are looking for.

We use steghide and “myadmin” to extract the data:

steghide extract -sf Minions1.jpeg

Open file “raw.txt“, we found a string: AEMAVABGAGwAZQBhAHIAbgB7AHQAaABpAHMAXwBpAHMAXwBmAHUAbgB9

Next, we decode that base64 string, we have: �C�T�F�l�e�a�r�n�{�t�h�i�s��i�s��f�u�n�}
